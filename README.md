Fractal Analysis
Fractals in trading help identify potential reversal points by marking significant price changes. Our strategy calculates a "fractal value" by comparing the current price to recent high and low fractal points. This is done by evaluating the sum of distances from the current closing price to the recent highs and lows. A positive fractal value suggests proximity to recent lows, hinting at upward momentum. Conversely, a negative value indicates closeness to recent highs, signaling potential downward movement.

Moving Averages for Confirmation
We use a series of 20 moving averages ranging from 5 to 100 to confirm trend directions indicated by fractal analysis. An entry signal is considered bullish when shorter-term moving averages are all above a long-term moving average, aligning with a positive fractal value.
Exit Strategy
The strategy employs dynamic stop-loss levels set at various moving averages, allowing for partial exits when the price crosses below specific thresholds. This helps manage the trade by locking in profits gradually. A full exit might be triggered by strong reversal signals suggested by both fractal values and moving average trends.
